# 05-Space-Shooter

Hello!

This is my second project: the Space Shooter.

I have used the code I turned in for E06a-Bullets as the baseline from which I built the game off of.
The code from the exercise can be found at https://github.com/stenixon0/E06a-Bullets/
and the original code can be found at https://github.com/BL-MSCH-C220-F19/E06a-Bullets

I intended to model the game off of Space Invaders or Galaga.

Left or Right arrow keys move the player.
Space Fires the bullet

The goal is to increase the score. 
Whenever all enemies are cleared, the score will increase and the enemy's speed will increase

If the player is hit 10 times in a wave, the program will exit

Thanks for playing!
